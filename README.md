# ParallelRays

This repository shows a demonstration of parallel rays of light at the top of Earth's atmosphere.

For simplicity's sake, the Earth was plotted at 1.5 * 10<sup>6<\sup> km away from the Sun, and both bodies are always vertically centered on the x-axis. A single plot showing a deviation of that is included in the images to show that this does not have an effect on the results of the demonstration.

Estimation of Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) is included as well, to demonstrate that the tilt and curvature affect the distribution of sunlight rather than the rays deviating from parallel.
